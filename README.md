## Write the Candy Factory Software and Save Halloween!

Candy orders will be given to you & will you have to produce a string which represents the packaged candy in the correct order. Candy can be of different colors & you have to use the first letter of each color to represent each candy (Y for yellow, G for green, R for red, etc.)

According to the Candy Factory operator's manual you must follow two rules when packaging the candy.  

### Rules: 
1. Green candy can't come after red candy  
2. Two yellow candies must have a blue or green candy between them (if available)  

### Examples: 
**Input:** `{ red: 3, green: 4, yellow: 7, blue: 3 }`  
**Output:** `GYBYBYBYGYGYGYRRR`  


**Input:** `{ red: 2, green: 3, yellow: 2, blue: 3 }`  
**Output:** `GGGYBYRRBB`  

_Note that any output combination is fine as long as it follows the two rules above._  

Have fun!
